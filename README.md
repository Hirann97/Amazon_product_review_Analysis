  # Amazon review project 

In this project, we are using Amazon review data to:

* Examine the emotions and opinions expressed by customers
* Discover strategies to retain and satisfy existing customers
* Anticipate what future reviews must hold
* Project how customer sentiment may evolve in the coming years
* Group customers based on their preferences and feedback

## Creating a Classification Model.

-we've developed three distinct models leveraging Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) techniques.
-We harnessed the power of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text vectorization.
-The bellow table shows how these models performed;

- The hyper-tuned Linear SVC model had the best results compared to all the others.

- MultinomialNB model takes less time for prediction.

- Hyper-tuned Linear SVC model takes less time than  Logistic

- As Hyper-tuned Linear SVC  is the best model, selecting that as the final model
